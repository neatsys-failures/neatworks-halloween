/// Safer alternative to raw `tokio::spawn`.
///
/// It can be used to spawn the set of *background tasks* which effectively
/// "abort the program if anything goes wrong", that is
/// * They are possible to go wrong (so unwrapping does not fit)
/// * Besides going wrong they only have trivial result (either `()` or `!`), so
///   not bother to join them manually that for propogating the error
/// * If they goes wrong there's no way or no meaning to recover, that is, we
///   would not bother to repair the system after any of them goes wrong,
///   instead we just want to make sure the capture the error reliably and fail
///   the whole system as a whole
///
/// Candidates for background tasks includes socket listener, message sender,
/// tasks with forever loop blocking on `SubmitSource`, etc. It is advised to
/// spawn these tasks with monitoring their status instead of just detaching
/// them, to make the system more predicatable. The model here is similar to
/// spawn the tasks into a `JoinSet`, just this can be shared acorss multiple
/// users and waiter.
///
/// Background tasks should bring their own shutdown policy. It is expected that
/// all background tasks shut themselves down under certain circumstance, so we
/// can confirm that they actually work well during lifetime. Remember to drop
/// unused `BackgroundSpawner`, or it may block monitor's `wait` call.
