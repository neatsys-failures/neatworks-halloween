/// Safer alternative to raw `tokio::spawn`.
///
/// It can be used to spawn the set of *background tasks* which effectively
/// "abort the program if anything goes wrong", that is
/// * They are possible to go wrong (so unwrapping does not fit)
/// * Besides going wrong they only have trivial result (either `()` or `!`), so
///   not bother to join them manually that for propogating the error
/// * If they goes wrong there's no way or no meaning to recover
///
/// Candidates for background tasks includes socket listener, tasks with forever
/// loop blocking on `SubmitSource`, etc. It is advised to spawn these tasks
/// with monitoring their status instead of just detaching them, to make the
/// system more predicatable. The model here is similar to spawn the tasks into
/// a `JoinSet`, just this can be shared acorss multiple users and waiter.
///
/// Background tasks should bring their own shutdown policy. It is expected that
/// all background tasks shut themselves down under certain circumstance, so we
/// can confirm that they actually work well during lifetime. Remember to drop
/// unused `BackgroundSpawner`, or it may block monitor's `wait` call.
