//! Producer-oriented transportation abstraction.
//!
//! Transport, i.e., network message sender, can be expressed with sender of
//! `(destination address(es), message)` event, or submit handle of such event
//! if synchronous transportation is desired. Actually an `impl Transport<M>` is
//! a lot like a `EventSender<(Addr, M)>`, in the sense it is required to be
//! `Send + Sync + Clone + 'static` and methods take a `&self`. You can use an
//! `impl Transport<M>` in the same way as using an event sender (or a submit
//! handle).
//!
//! The purpose of a dedicated `Transport<M>` trait is to decouple
//! transportation implementations with transported message type `M`, and enable
//! a session that sends `M` to work with any `impl Transport<M>` consumers.
//! The transportation semantic may be arbitrary, e.g., send `M` as is, convert
//! it into another message type before sending, or even discard it.
//!
//! The alternative approach is to use service session to perform message type
//! based polymorphism (as described in the session overview document). A trait
//! could be better because it allow straightforward, even automatical adapting
//! from a `impl Transport<M>` to `impl Transport<N>`, which fits the common
//! scenario where the session's owner (potentially its super-session) instead
//! of the underlying transport provider wants to customize the transport
//! semantic.
//!
//! The cases that demand such decoupling include multiplexing, where a
//! sub-session should be working with any compatible super-session that uses
//! a on-wire message format that is unknown to the sub-session. In this case,
//! the sub-session can take a `impl Transport<M>` for its message type `M`, and
//! it's super-session's responsibility to convert the sub-session's messages
//! into its own format, i.e., provide `impl Transport<M>` for the sub-session.
//!
//! (Super-session is also responsible for decoding and dispatching sub-session
//! messages, which happens naturally in session logic and does not require an
//! abstraction.)
